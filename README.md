## Hi, I'm Kuba! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate and creative full-stack developer with a strong background in automation engineering and programming PLC controllers. With experience in both industrial automation and software development, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and problem-solving skills to my work.

I have about 5 years of experience as a self-employed full-stack developer and during this time I successfully developed several commercial and open source web applications for private and public sectors. Currently I'm on the finish of the cooperation with AppGreat Company which is recreation of the <a href="http://multivee.pl/en" >Multivee</a> system in the cloud. The project involved building all from scratch eg. CMS using SvelteKit. WebSockets-based Gateways for bidirectional connection to facilities to control TVs and other available smart devices. PWA for remote control of TVs by guests and other top-notch solutions. (3-person Agile team)

If you are looking for a motivated and versatile full-stack developer who can seamlessly blend technical expertise with a strong work ethic, I would be delighted to connect and explore potential opportunities. Let's collaborate and create remarkable solutions together!ðŸ§¡
